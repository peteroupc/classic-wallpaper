## Rust Wallpaper Generator

Rust version of an application that displays a randomly generated desktop wallpaper.

This is also an example of how to build, with Rust, a cross-platform graphical user interface application which:

- Runs on any platform supported by the `winit` library, including Linux and, through WebAssembly, the World Wide Web platform.
- Relies on a software frame buffer of fixed size, here, 640 &times; 480.
- Can serve as a framework for [retro-style game applications](https://peteroupc.github.io/graphics.html) (such as those reminiscent of the 1990s).
